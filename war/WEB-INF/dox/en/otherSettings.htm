<p>
  UI performance represents the responsiveness of the user interface. This includes all activities that are managed via
  the long poll mechanism, such as the maximum alarm level indicator, watchlist updating, event list updates, etc. If
  the Lsscl host has a limited-power CPU, you may want to set the UI performance to a lower level to prevent users 
  browsers from consuming too much of the hosts CPU.

  Use the "purge events" settings to set the maximum age of an event before it is purged from the database. Purging 
  permanently deletes the event as well as any user comments associated with it.
</p>

<p>
  Use the "purge report instances" settings to set the maximum age of a report instance before it is purged from the 
  database. Purging permanently deletes the report instance. It is best to set this value as low as possible since 
  reports can potentially consume a great deal of available storage space. Purging can be prevented by setting the 
  "prevent purge" attribute on the report instance.

<p>
  Click the <b>Purge all data</b> button to permanently delete all point samples currently in the database. This can be
  useful for giving a Lsscl instance a "fresh start", especially if spurious data exists from configuration and set up
  activities.

<p>
  User the "Discard point values future dated" settings to set the maximum amount of time into the future for which 
  data points will accept new values. Any values with timestamps that exceed this value will be discarded, and an error
  message will be written to the log.
