<p>Cron patterns originated from the unix-based "cron" (from "chronological") utility. Although the patterns may at first appear arcane, they are in fact simple, powerful, and elegant ways of defining a large set of time-based events.</p>

<p>Cron patterns in Lsscl are implemented by Quartz, a Java-based scheduling library. More information on the definition of cron patterns can be found here: <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/wikidocs/CronTriggers%20Tutorial.html" target="_blank">CronTriggers Tutorial</a>.</p>
